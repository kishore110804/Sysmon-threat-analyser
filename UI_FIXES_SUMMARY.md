# UI Fixes Summary - Analysis Page

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Loading Screen Not Showing
**Problem**: Analysis page remained stuck on upload screen during processing
**Solution**: 
- Added proper state management with `isAnalyzing` flag
- Created dedicated loading screen with animated spinner
- Shows progress messages during analysis
- Clear separation between upload → loading → results states

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Loading state now shows dedicated screen
{isAnalyzing ? (
  <div className="vercel-card rounded-2xl p-16 text-center">
    <Loader2 className="w-16 h-16 animate-spin text-blue-400" />
    <h3>Analyzing Your Data</h3>
    <p>{analysisProgress}</p>
  </div>
) : !showResults ? (
  // Upload section
) : (
  // Results section
)}
```

### 2. ✅ Button Visibility Issues
**Problem**: White text on white/light backgrounds made buttons invisible
**Fixed Buttons**:

#### "New Analysis" Button
- **Before**: `border-white/10 hover:bg-white/5` (barely visible)
- **After**: `border-white/20 hover:border-white/40 hover:bg-white/10 text-white` (clearly visible)

#### "Download Sample Data" Button  
- **Before**: `border-white/10 hover:bg-white/5` (invisible text)
- **After**: `border-white/20 hover:border-white/40 hover:bg-white/10 text-white` (white text)

#### "Export JSON" Button
- **Before**: `border-white/10 hover:bg-white/5` (invisible text)
- **After**: `border-white/20 hover:border-white/40 hover:bg-white/10 text-white` (white text)

### 3. ✅ Download Buttons Now Functional

#### Download Report Button
**Feature**: Downloads comprehensive text report with:
- File metadata (name, date, processing time)
- Summary statistics (events, threats, processes)
- Severity breakdown (high, medium, low)
- Top MITRE ATT&CK tactics
- Detailed threat detections with:
  - MITRE technique IDs
  - Severity levels
  - Confidence scores
  - Descriptions
  - Tactics

**File Format**: `.txt` (plain text report)
**Filename**: `sysmon-analysis-YYYY-MM-DD.txt`

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const handleDownloadReport = () => {
  // Creates formatted text report
  // Includes all analysis data
  // Downloads as .txt file
}
```

#### Export JSON Button
**Feature**: Exports complete analysis results as JSON
- All analysis data preserved
- Programmatically parseable
- Includes all detection details
- Pretty-printed with 2-space indentation

**File Format**: `.json`
**Filename**: `sysmon-analysis-YYYY-MM-DD.json`

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const handleExportJSON = () => {
  // Exports entire analysisResults object
  // Downloads as formatted JSON
}
```
